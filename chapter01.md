# 1. What is deep learning?

World changing development vs Overhyped press releases

## 1.1 Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning

### 1.1.1 Artificial Intelligence

John McCarty organizes a summer workshop (1956).

- Can computers (machines) think?
- Simulating learning
- Machines use language
- Human reserved problems
- In one summer ?!

> AI: "The effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans."

- AI may also **not include any learning**

- Symbolic AI: hard coded rules (handcrafting explicit steps) to solve a problem

- Symbolic AI was the dominant paradigm until 1980s. It was good for solving chess but computationally intractable for image classification

### 1.1.2 Machine Learning

Ada Lovelace (1843),

> "The analytical engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform... It's province is to assist us making available what we're already actuantied with."

- Could a general-purpose computer **originate** anything?

Alan Turing (1950),

- Computers in principle be made to emulate all aspects of human intelligence

- ML started in 1990s

- Statistics to ML is like chemistry to medicine

### 1.1.3 Learning rules and representations from data

For machine learning we need 3 components:

- Input data points
- Examples of the expected output
- A way to measure whether the algorithm is doing a good job

ML is actually all about finding the successful representations of the input data.

Learning is an automatic search process for data transformations like coordinate changes, linear projections, etc.

ML is searching representations in the "hypothesis space"

### 1.1.4 The "deep" in "deep learning"

- Learning **successive layers** of increasingly meaningful representations

- ML (shallow learning) uses one or two layers

- On the other hand DL uses tens or even hundreds of layers

- Models for DL is neural networks

- One can think layers in DL as an "information-distillation" process

### 1.1.5 Understanding how deep learning works

- The specification of what a layer does to its input data is stored in the layer's weights

- Learning is nothing but finding the set of values for the weights of all layers in a network

- Loss function = Cost function = Objective function

- Optimizer uses loss socre as a feedback signal and adjust the values of the weights a little. This is called the **"backpropagation"**

### 1.1.6 What deep learning has achieved so far?

Altough DL is fairly old, it only rose to prominence in the early 2010s

### 1.1.7 Don't believe the short-term hype

Autonomous caes are within react but human-level general intelligence may take a lot of years

### 1.1.8 The promise of AI

Most of the research findings of DL aren't yet applied.
